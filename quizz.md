# QUIZZ GAME

Goal : Make a multiplayer quizz game about the melee ranking website.

## Features

* Login / Password to store name & scores.
* Multiplayer real time game.
* Auto-generated questions based on queries.
* Points given based on your speed / placement. (like in Mario Party, where first gets 10, second gets 7, third gets 4, last gets 1) (other example : skribbl.io).
* Sessions
	* Unique sessions every X minutes
	* Custom & public sessions, sharable with a code or a link (like in skribbl.io)

## What we need 

* Websockets
* Very dynamic 
* Send data + timestamp to the server, take who's the quickest, attribute points & store scores (if logged in).

## Other ideas

* Being able to claim your melee ranking page via your account
